Sure! The bitsetter function (formerly known as mask_helper) is a versatile and flexible approach to generate bitmasks in embedded development, especially when dealing with bit manipulation and setting multiple bits in a bitmask.

## Advantages of bitsetter for Embedded Development:

1. Flexibility: The function allows you to set any combination of bits in the bitmask by specifying the bit positions as variadic arguments. This flexibility makes it suitable for situations where you need to manipulate different bits in a bitmask without having to write multiple separate functions.

2. Compact Code: The function uses bitwise operations to efficiently set the specified bits in the bitmask. This approach ensures that the code remains compact and efficient, which is crucial in resource-constrained embedded systems.

3. Avoids Magic Numbers: By using the bitsetter function with named constants like TM_FREQ_64 and TM_FREQ_1024, you can avoid using magic numbers directly in your code. This enhances code readability and maintainability, making it easier for other developers to understand the purpose of the bitmask.

4. Inline Expansion: The INLINE keyword suggests to the compiler that the function can be inlined at the call site. This can lead to faster code execution by reducing the overhead of function calls, which is particularly useful in embedded systems with limited computational resources.

5. Static Scope: The static keyword provides internal linkage to the function, limiting its visibility to the current translation unit (source file). This promotes encapsulation and helps prevent naming conflicts with other functions in different files, making the code more modular and organized.

In summary, the bitsetter function is a highly useful and optimized approach to handle bit manipulation and bitmask generation in embedded development. By using this function, you can efficiently set specific bits in a bitmask, and the code remains concise, easy to understand, and optimized for embedded systems.
